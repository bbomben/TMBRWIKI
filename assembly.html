            The most important strategy for designing an assembly is to simplify
            as much as possible to ensure easy and fast on site construction.
            This is because the more trades you have on site, there is the
            potential for more mistakes of intellectual misalignments and
            material and products miss fittings. As a result, striving for
            assemblies that require a minimum number of trades, needing little
            or no temporary support, requiring no special tools, and a minimal
            need for ladders or scaffolding will increase onsite assembly
            (Kaufmann, et. al, 2018).
            <br /><br />
            A universal system of picking and setting is desirable as it
            mitigates differences in hoisting and placing equipment and will
            significantly increase construction time. It is then essential to
            design a prefabricated kit of parts to have similar sizing or
            ‘pick-points’ for easy assembly.
            <br /><br />
            For the assembly of 1D systems, try to use standard sizing for all
            components wherever possible and ensure that members require simple
            lifting equipment. In the same light, simplify connection details
            between elements and use repetition of elements as much as possible.
            Taking these considerations into the design of members can also
            positively influence manufacturing and transportation.
            <br /><br />
            The assembly of 2D systems are like the 1D systems rules of thumb
            and should try to maximize their size as much as possible, in
            relation to manufacturing and transportation. As the large format
            components enable a fast assembly and ensure the building is well
            braced. Moreover, just like for all systems, avoid custom sizes or
            one-off cuts to ensure fast construction. Furthermore, correct
            lapping of joints must be considered to avoid any failures.
            <br /><br />
            When it comes to 3D systems, the larger the modules, the more
            cost-effective the structure will be. Just as 2D systems, it is
            imperative that 3D systems can be easily hoisted from their
            transport and into place. Moreover, it is recommended that along
            with final finishing's, the final façade should be assembled onsite
            as well. The reason being is that the designer then has more freedom
            on the final aesthetic of the project and can potentially hide the
            regulating joints of the modules to create a seamless appearance. A
            prime example of this can be seen in the Puukuokka Housing Block
            (OOPEAA, 2021).

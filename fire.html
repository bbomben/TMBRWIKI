            The rule of thumb for 1D systems is that individual supports must
            only be designed to retain their structural integrity (R).
            Furthermore, the behavior of timber structural elements in fire is
            greatly influenced by the proportion of surface to cross section and
            the densities of various woods. As a result, for 1D system members
            to meet potential fire requirements, their cross-section may be
            enlarged if exposed timber is desired. Alternatively, the member can
            be cladded in a non-combustible material (typical one or two layers
            of 16mm or greater fire-resistant gypsum).
            <br /><br />
            For all system types, most connectors are fabricated from steel and
            the performance of steel in high temperatures deteriorates.
            Typically, the connectors will be protected within a fire board or
            within a floor and wall assembly.
            <br /><br />
            The rules of thumb stated for residential 2D systems can also be
            applied to educational typologies. However, it is important to note
            that educational typologies typically require a fire resistance of
            30-60 minutes, depending on overall building height and footprint.
            For example, the Wood Innovation and Design Centre requires 60
            minutes and is considered building class 5, while the European
            Frankfurt School requires a 30-minute resistance rating and is
            considered building class 3 (Kaufmann, et. al, 2018). Often,
            educational typologies will utilize sprinkler systems to help attain
            their fire resistance rating, while adding additional layers of
            gypsum to walls, floors and ceilings.
            <br /><br />
            The rules of thumb for fire and 3D timber systems are like that of
            the 2D rules of thumb. However, in both residential and educational
            cases, the double stacking of floors and walls should be considered.
            7 The double stacking of CLT panels increases the fire resistance
            rating of the project and results in the potential for thinner CLT
            Panels for each module.

              As a result of Glue laminated timber being rarely used in
              multi-storey residential units, there are no specific fire rules
              of thumb for this condition. As stated previously, it is
              recommended to utilize 2D, 3D or a combination of both for
              residential units.

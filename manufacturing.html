            Manufacturing for 1D systems addresses the process of creating
            Glue-laminated Timber beams and columns. To form a glulam component,
            wood lamination's (dimensional lumber) are positioned according to
            their stress-rated performance characteristics (Think Wood, 2020).
            Typically, the maximum width to be manufactured is 365mm. However,
            members that are wider than 365mm are manufactured in 50mm
            increments and become exponentially more expensive. The depth of a
            glulam member is a function of the number of lamination's multiplied
            by the lamination thickness. As a result, depths typically range
            from: 114mm - 2128mm. In theory, the overall lengths of glulam
            members are only restricted by transportation and assembly
            requirements. Otherwise, it is up to the designer to determine the
            final length of the member.

            <br /><br />

            Manufacturing for 2D systems deals with cross-laminated timber
            (CLT). Where the maximum panel length is 16500mm, the maximum panel
            width is 3500mm, and the maximum panel thickness is typically 500mm.
            During the manufacturing process of CLT panels, it is best practice
            to integrate technical installations within the assembly, such as
            raised floor systems. This allows for installations to be completed
            with a high degree of accuracy in a controlled environment,
            ultimately saving time on site. However, it is recommended that the
            final floor and wall finishing's should be added on site in order to
            cover up spacing tolerances between floor and wall panels.
            <br /><br />
            Following similar sizing conditions of 2D manufacturing to produce
            3D modules. 3D systems manufacturing is favorable because they can
            be designed as airtight as possible to improve acoustic and fire
            requirements. Due to the controlled conditions of an off-site
            facility rather than dealing with unexpected onsite conditions. It
            is best practice to integrate technical installations within the
            module in order to decrease time on site. According to Kieran
            Timberlake, the ‘wet’ construction program of a project such as
            kitchen, bathroom, laundry, are the most extensive areas of
            construction (Kieran and Timberlake, 2008). Since these programs
            require multiple trades to complete. As a result, when designing a
            3D system, it is best practice to separate the modules into ‘Wet’
            and ‘Dry’ construction. An example of this can be examined in the
            Puukuokka Housing Block case study and can clearly be seen how two
            modules (‘wet’ and ‘dry’) come together to form a single unit
            (OOPEAA, 2021).

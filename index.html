                As mass timber continues to grow in popularity, so too does the
                amount of information. This website is a prototype to provide
                designers a platform for simplified timber research. Allowing
                those wanting to utilize timber to easily make informed
                decisions early in the design process.

        <p>
          Outlined below are rules of thumb for 6 major categories that
          influence mass timber projects. It is important to be aware of the
          parameters that can influence your projects so that one can design
          more consciously in the beginning, rather than having to make major
          corrections when it comes time to prepare your project for
          construction. These rules of thumb are intended to make more informed
          decisions during preliminary design, ultimately making the following
          design development and construction document phase easier later on.

          <br /><br />
          Within the 6 major categories; manufacturing, transportation,
          assembly, structure, fire and acoustics. There are 3 sub-categories (
          or 'systems') for mass timber which include 1D, 2D and 3D systems.

              It is important to note that a CLT solution that is 4 storey’s or
              less would use more CLT than required. Therefore it is recommended
              to go 5 storey’s or higher when proposing an engineered timber
              project that utilizes CLT. However, this is purely from an
              optimization perspective.

              Another aspect of timber structures is that mass timber structures
              prefer to be stacked, avoiding cantilevers and 'transfer slab'
              like conditions although it can be done. <br /><br />

          <div class="description-2">
            <p>
              For acoustic rules of thumb, the research was based on German
              context as it currently has the highest level of sound
              requirements for residential typologies. Resulting in these
              requirements becoming the typical rules of thumb for projects
              going forward to attain the most optimum acoustic conditions.
              <br /><br />
              It is important to note that impact sound can be understood as the
              sound generated from foot fall, moving furniture or anything that
              makes direct contact with a floor slab that in turn generates
              sound. While airborne sound is generated from things like
              conversation, music and other audible sources and it has a
              significant impact on flanking.

              <br /><br />Flanking sound is an essential consideration and
              should be addressed through detailing of components by providing
              acoustical breaks where timber members meet and should be
              considered for 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. Subsequently, there are two
              methods to minimize this which include, vibration damping using
              flanking transmission barriers and separate inner cladding of
              load-bearing elements. <br /><br />

                For 2D systems, in both residential and educational typologies
                it is imperative that the detailing of CLT panels takes flanking

                must be an acoustical break bet ween CLT panel members.

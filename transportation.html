            Transportation of 1D and 2D systems is straightforward in that it is
            most cost effective if members are stacked regularly and compactly
            with no wasted space and no requirements for wide or long loads.
            There are different restrictions depending on whether the truck has
            no escort, an escort vehicle on Urban and country roads and a police
            escort vehicle on Urban and country roads. These different
            requirements should be determined early on as it further influences
            the overall dimensionality of the designed prefabricated system(s).
            <br /><br />
            It is advised that the transportation of 3D systems should be well
            considered, since 3D modules contain a lot of dead space within
            themselves while being transported, as opposed to stack panels,
            beams and columns. It is important to note that the size of the 3D
            module will influence the number of trips that are required to bring
            everything to site, the larger the module, the more trips required
            which increases transportation time and cost. However, it is also
            important to acknowledge that the increased time spent on
            transportation is often countered by efficient prefab production as
            well as efficient on-site assembly.

              To ensure transportation is most effective, prefabricated members

              Transportation of 3D modules follows the same size conditions as
              2D systems. However, since 3D modules contain a lot of dead space
              within themselves while being transported, as opposed to stack
              panels, beams and columns. Depending on the size of the 3D module,
              the more trips are required to bring everything to site, affecting
              overall construction time. However, this is to be balanced with
              assembly rules of thumb.

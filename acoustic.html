            In comparison, for educational typologies there are different
            functioning rooms within a project that require different levels of
            sound insulation. Often what separates residential and educational
            acoustic requirements is the use of drop ceilings in educational
            spaces. These drop ceilings provide a quiet environment to work and
            present within, mitigating the reverberation within the space. There
            is then more of a focus placed on the ceiling design of an
            educational space along with adding further sound insulation to the
            walls. Along with the typical use of beams to create larger open
            spaces to work within, the acoustic design of the ceiling has a
            major impact on the dimensionality of assemblies required to produce
            a well-functioning space.
            <br /><br />
            The floor assemblies of 2D systems utilize the same rules of thumb
            as residential 2D systems, however in an educational typology
            context. The amount of acoustical sound insulation is considerably
            less in both floor and wall assemblies. Ranging from 7mm to 30mm of
            impact sound insulation in floor assemblies (Kaufmann, et. al,
            2018). For example, in the Wood Innovation and Design Centre, there
            is only 7mm specified impact sound insulation. Yet the floor
            assembly also enables an integrated drop ceiling and raised floor
            that helps to contribute to overall acoustical performance. As a
            result, it appears that educational typologies try to minimize the
            assembly as much as possible and instead use off-set acoustic
            interventions such as drop ceilings.
            <br /><br />
            For educational 3D systems, the rules of thumb are like residential
            3D systems. Using the European Frankfurt School case study, there is
            25mm of impact sound insulation in the floor assembly, and 60mm of
            thermal insulation with the floor assembly of the module and another
            60mm of insulation in the ceiling, contributing to the overall
            acoustic performance of the classrooms (Kaufmann, et. al, 2018). As
            a result, looking at just the stacking of floor plates, the
            educational building is 87.5mm thinner than that of the Puukuokka
            Housing Block. It is also noticed that like the Puukuokka Housing
            Block, the Frankfurt School utilizes acoustical breaks where the
            modules connect in order to mitigate vibrations throughout the
            modules.

              For 2D systems, in both residential and educational typologies it
              is imperative that the detailing of CLT panels takes flanking into
              consideration during the design. To mitigate this, there must be
              an acoustical break bet ween CLT panel members. Typically 5mm-10mm
              thick.

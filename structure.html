            Beam geometries make use of the fact that load-bearing capacity
            increases exponentially with the distance between the upper and
            lower areas of a structurally effective cross section. As a result,
            the greater the span, the greater the depth of beam is required.
            Referring to the manufacturing rules of thumb for 1D systems, the
            width of the beam comes in predetermined sizes depending on the
            manufacturer. Therefore, a glulam beam for an office or education
            program, while referring to a product chart, one can use the
            calculation L/16 to determine the depth of a beam. Where L = the
            span in millimeters.
            <br /><br />
            This rule of thumb was tested on the Wood Innovation and Design
            Centre case study where it was a 7- storey building with spans of
            8000mm with 500mm deep beams. Using the rule of thumb: 8000/16 =
            500mm. It is important to note that calculating for column sizes
            becomes extremely complicated and should preliminarily be determined
            through case study examples.
            <br /><br />
            In order to calculate the thickness of a CLT floor panel (2D
            system), one can use the calculation L/47 to determine the depth of
            a beam. Where L = the span in millimeters. The rule of thumb was
            then tested against the Wood Innovation and Design Centre case study
            where there are two layers of CLT panels that overlap on top of each
            other. For simplification, the rule of thumb was applied to the
            ‘bottom’ CLT panel that spans 8000mm from beam to beam. As a result,
            8000/47= 170mm in relation to the 169mm specified.
            <br /><br />
            To determine the ‘ceiling’ depth of a CLT panel in a 3D Module. The
            ceiling panel is typically ±25% thinner than that of the CLT Floor
            panel in a residential module, typically a 3-Layer Floor and a 3-
            Layer Ceiling. The rule of thumb was then tested on the European
            Frankfurt School case study and proved to be accurate floor to
            ceiling ratio for educational 3D systems.
            <br /><br />
            For both 2D and 3D CLT wall panels, the range of depth is typically
            80-150mm thick (Comprising 3 or 5 Layers).
